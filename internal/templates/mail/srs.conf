# SRS (Sender Rewriting Scheme) Configuration for Exim4
# Reference: RFC 4408 SPF, SRS Specification
#
# SRS helps maintain SPF compliance when forwarding or relaying emails
# by rewriting the sender domain to your server's domain on outgoing mail.
#
# When mail is forwarded:
# - Original sender: user@example.com
# - Rewritten sender: SRS0=address+hash=example.com=user@yourdomain.com
# - On bounce: SRS rewrites back to original sender
#
# This prevents SPF check failures on forwarded emails

# SRS Secret Key (required for encoding/decoding)
# IMPORTANT: This should be a random 16+ character string
# Change this value and restart exim4 to invalidate old SRS addresses
# Keep this secret and don't share between servers unless intentional
webstack-srs-secret-key-v1

# Note: The key is used in exim4.conf as:
# SRS_SECRET = webstack-srs-secret-key-v1
#
# If you want to use a different key, edit both this file AND exim4.conf
