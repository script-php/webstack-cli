# Reference: Hestia Control Panel
#
# Format: cidr_address : comment
#
# Add trusted IP addresses or subnets here in CIDR format
# Whitelisted IPs bypass DNSBL and spam checks
# Example:
# 203.0.113.0/24 : Our ISP range
# 192.0.2.50/32 : Trusted partner server
#
# This list is checked at SMTP connection time
# Entries here bypass all connection-level checks
