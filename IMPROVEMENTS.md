# WebStack CLI Installation Improvements

## Summary of Changes

### 1. **Component Detection & Management**
- Added pre-installation checks for all components (Nginx, Apache, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, PHP versions, phpMyAdmin, phpPgAdmin)
- When a component is already installed, users are prompted with options:
  - **[k] Keep** - Keep current installation unchanged
  - **[r] Reinstall** - Remove and reinstall the component
  - **[u] Uninstall** - Remove the component only
  - **[s] Skip** - Skip installing this component

### 2. **Improved Interactive Prompts**
- Fixed phpMyAdmin installation prompts that were not waiting for user input
- Replaced basic `askYesNo()` with `improvedAskYesNo()` that:
  - Waits properly for user input
  - Provides clear error messages for invalid inputs
  - Has better input validation and retry logic

### 3. **Better phpMyAdmin Installation**
- Added pre-installation instructions to guide users
- Implemented configuration pre-seeding to reduce interactive prompts
- Added pause before installation so users can read instructions
- Used `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive` where appropriate

### 4. **Enhanced User Experience**
- Added clear status messages and progress indicators
- Better organization of installation steps with section headers
- Improved error handling and feedback
- More descriptive action confirmations

## Usage Examples

### Install with Smart Detection
```bash
# Will check existing installations and prompt for action
sudo webstack install all

# Individual component installation also has detection
sudo webstack install nginx
sudo webstack install php 8.2
```

### Check System Status
```bash
# Use existing system status command
sudo webstack system status
```

## Benefits

1. **No Accidental Overwrites**: Users are always asked before reinstalling existing components
2. **Flexible Management**: Can remove, keep, or reinstall components as needed
3. **Better phpMyAdmin Experience**: No more hanging on configuration prompts
4. **Cleaner Installations**: Users can clean up existing installations before proceeding
5. **Better Feedback**: Clear status messages throughout the process

## Technical Implementation

- Added `ComponentStatus` enum and `Component` struct for systematic checking
- Implemented `checkComponentStatus()` and `checkPHPVersion()` functions
- Created `promptForAction()` for consistent user interaction
- Added `uninstallComponent()` and `uninstallPHP()` for clean removal
- Enhanced `improvedAskYesNo()` with better input handling

All existing functionality is preserved while adding these smart detection and management features.
