## ✨ WHAT WENT WELL

1. **Go Embed Package** - Templates embedded perfectly, single binary works great
2. **Cobra Framework** - CLI structure scales beautifully as new commands added
3. **Template System** - Configuration generation is flexible and maintainable
4. **Error Handling** - Consistent patterns throughout, user-friendly feedback
5. **Domain Management** - Full CRUD with automatic config generation
6. **SSL Support** - Both certificate types work, smart domain detection works

---

## ⚠️ WHAT NEEDS ATTENTION

1. **Database Configuration** - Stubs exist but empty, high priority
2. **PHP-FPM Tuning** - Not applied per-version, affects performance
3. **SSL Automation** - Renewal works but needs scheduling
4. **Testing** - None implemented yet, should add before v1.0
5. **Documentation** - Good start but missing advanced guides

---

## 📞 KEY CONTACTS

- **Repository**: https://github.com/script-php/webstack-cli
- **Branch**: main
- **Language**: Go 1.25.3
- **Framework**: Cobra v1.10.1

---

## 🎓 LESSONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

1. **Go embed is perfect for CLI tools** - Eliminates path resolution issues
2. **Template-based config generation is very flexible** - Handles variations well
3. **Pre-installation checks prevent errors** - Worth the extra validation
4. **Dual web server setup requires careful port management** - Current approach (80 Nginx, 8080 Apache) works well
5. **User prompts are essential** - Interactive mode keeps users safe, flags enable automation

---

## ✅ CONCLUSION

**The WebStack CLI project is in good shape:**
- ✅ Core architecture is solid
- ✅ Main features work correctly
- ✅ Well-structured code
- ✅ Good user experience
- ⚠️ Needs database/PHP/SSL automation completion
- ⚠️ Needs testing and distribution setup

**Estimated to v1.0 Release**: 4-6 weeks with focused development
